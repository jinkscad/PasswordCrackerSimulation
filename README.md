## 📋 Overview

A professional web application for analyzing password security, checking breach exposure, and demonstrating password attack methodologies. Built for educational purposes to promote better password security practices.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔒 Password Breach Checker
- **Real breach data** from Have I Been Pwned API
- **Privacy-focused** k-anonymity model (only first 5 hash chars sent)
- **Visual breach timeline** showing when passwords were leaked
- **Risk assessment** with color-coded indicators
- **Actionable recommendations**

### 📊 Password Strength Analyzer
- Comprehensive strength scoring (0-100)
- Character composition analysis
- Entropy calculation
- Common pattern detection
- Real-time feedback

### 🔐 Hash Generator
- Support for MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512
- Quick hash generation for testing
- Copy-friendly output

### 📚 Dictionary Attack Simulator
- **500+ password dictionary** with variations
- **Password variations** (substitutions, case changes, patterns)
- **Pattern matching** (Password123, password@123, etc.)
- **Pause/Resume/Stop** controls
- **Real-time progress** with WebSocket updates
- **Detailed statistics** and tested passwords list

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jinkscad/PasswordCrackerSimulation.git
cd PasswordCrackerSimulation

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

python app.py

# Open browser
# http://localhost:5001
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Analyze password strength
python main.py analyze --password "MyP@ssw0rd"

# Generate hash
python main.py hash --password "test" --algorithm md5

# Dictionary attack
python main.py dictionary
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Render (Recommended)

1. Connect GitHub repository to Render
2. Create new Web Service
3. Configure:
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `python app.py`
   - **Environment Variables:**
     - `FLASK_ENV=production`
     - `PORT=10000`
     - `HOST=0.0.0.0`

See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **k-Anonymity Model:** Only first 5 characters of password hash sent to HIBP API
- **No Password Storage:** Passwords are never stored or logged
- **Local Hashing:** All hashing done client-side before API calls
- **HTTPS Required:** All deployments use HTTPS encryption

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Educational Purpose Only**

This tool is designed for:
- Learning password security principles
- Demonstrating attack methodologies
- Promoting better security practices

**Do NOT use for:**
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Cracking passwords without permission
- Any illegal activities

Always ensure you have explicit permission before testing security.

---

## 📚 Key Learnings

- **Password Length Matters:** Each character exponentially increases security
- **Complexity is Key:** Mixing character types significantly improves strength
- **Breach Exposure:** Common passwords are highly vulnerable
- **Unique Passwords:** Random, unique passwords resist dictionary attacks
- **Modern Hashing:** Use bcrypt/Argon2 instead of MD5/SHA1

---

## 🤝 Contributing
